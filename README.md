# django-book-keep
My take on Django. It's simple app that's generating list of books.
You can access Admin site by for example (when running locally):
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

Website itself can be run from:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/Bookeep/

To start website locally just go to folder location in cmd and type:

"python manage.py runserver"

If you would like to create your own superuser to test app:

"python manage.py createsuperuser"
